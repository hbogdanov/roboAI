# RoboAI
RoboAI bridges natural-language understanding and robotics. Using a pair of Transformer models, the system can both interpret user instructions and explain its reasoning in natural language after executing a task. Built with Webots, PyTorch, and HuggingFace Transformers, this project demonstrates human-robot communication powered by AI.
